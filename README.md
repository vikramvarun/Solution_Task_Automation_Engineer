Problem statement

A sentence is composed of words and each word is composed of letters.
Assuming value of each letter equals its position in the alphabet and 
value of each word is the sum of the value of the letters, write a function to 
order the words of the sentence in the ascending order. 
(a=1, b=2,... etc)
cat = 3 + 1 + 20 = 24

In case two words have the same value, then position them in the order of their occurrence.

Eg 1: 
a cat runs faster than the tortoise
converts to:
1 24  72   69       43    33  121
and on ordering the sentence becomes:
a cat the than faster runs tortoise

Eg 2.
the enemy is rooting for a dot ball 
converts to:
33  62        28  98      39 1 39  27
and on ordering the sentence becomes:
a ball is the for dot enemy rooting
